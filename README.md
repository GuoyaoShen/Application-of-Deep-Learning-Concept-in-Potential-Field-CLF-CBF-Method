# Application-of-Deep-Learning-Concept-in-Potential-Field-CLF-CBF-Method
Some initial thoughs and corresponding work of applying optimizers and activation functions in potential-based path finding task.

* Use script "test_optimizer.m" as a start. "test_plot_field.m" will give out the potential field and corresponding vector flow field of the maps.
